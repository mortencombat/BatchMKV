# BatchMKV

BatchMKV is a tool that can be used for batch-usage of [MakeMKV](https://makemkv.com/), such as ripping multiple DVDs and Blu-rays in a single workflow.

BatchMKV requires both MakeMKV and [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/).

There is a [thread on the official MakeMKV forums](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9345) with more information and discussion.
